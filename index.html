<h1> Board Game Blog </h1>

  <p>
    I am a long-time game enthusiast and have always found boardgames to be some of the . . .
  </p>
  
  <h2> Catan </h2>  
  <p>
    Catan is a game that has an unqiue combination of luck and skill. The objective of the game is relatively straight forward. The object of the game is straight forward enough, be the first to earn <strong> 10 Victory </strong> points. It is played on a board made up of hexagonal resource tile and players compete to expand their territory and harvest said tiles. There is bargaining and deception . . . TBC

  <p>
    Turns are played in the following order:
    
    <ol>
      
      <li> Trade cards or play Knight card
      <li> Roll dice </li>
      
        <ul>
          <li> If 7: Move robber to new tile and steal 1 resource from town adjacent to robber </li>
          <li> Else: Players collect appropriate resources </li>
        </ul>

      <li> Trade cards or play Development card </li>
      
        <ul>
          <li> Trades can be made to the 'bank' at 4:1
          <li> Follow Development card instructions</li>
        </ul>
      
      <li> Build Phase </li>
      <li> Pass the dice </li>

    </ol>

    <em> That about sums it up. </em>
